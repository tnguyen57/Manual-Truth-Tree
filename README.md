<h1>Manual-Truth-Tree </h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p> Manual Truth Tree is a software that will allow users to create truth trees manually. Truth Trees are a powerful logical tool to help prove implications.</p>

<p>While there are software to create a truth tree automatically, there are barely any software that let users to create a truth tree directly. The best example of a software that does this is TFTrees on "BramHub". https://github.com/Bram-Hub/TFTrees.</p>

<p>While TFTrees has been getting yearly updates to it, the updates are more for fixing the existing code then extending it. With this project, the goal is to make an easy to maintain, easy to use, extensible, and tested product from the start, so that future development can go towards features.</p>
